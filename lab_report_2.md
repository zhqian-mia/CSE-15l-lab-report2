First step, create a web server called `StringServer`. In order to do that, open the github desktop, and open the weaver by VS code.  
Then, you need to create a new file and named it `StringServer.java`    
Write your code inside the new file. Below is a screenshot of mine.

Now in the command line, enter `javac Server.java StringServer.java` ,and then enter `java StringServer 7028`  (select any port number that you like).  
Now the terminal should look like this.

Open the link using Google, you should see something like this initially.
