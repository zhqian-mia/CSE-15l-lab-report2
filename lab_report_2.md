Lab report 2
First step, create a web server called StringServer. In order to do that, open the github desktop, and open the weaver by VS code.  
Then, you need to create a new file and named it StringServer.java  
Write your code inside the new file. Below is a screenshot of mine.  
  
Now in the command line, enter javac Server.java StringServer.java and then enter java StringServer 7028  (select any port number that you like).  
Now the terminal should look like this.
